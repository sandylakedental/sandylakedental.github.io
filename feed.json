He opened his own office in a tiny space attached to the Mercer County State Bank in February of 1982. This tiny office had 2 operatories and 2 full time staff members.\n<br>\n<br>As the word spread of Dr. Charlton’s gentle demeanor and pleasant chair-side manner he continued to get busier. New staff needed to be added to enable the doctor to accommodate the patient flow. Through the 80’s he added two more full time staff as well as a part-time hygienist. In a very short time the practice grew beyond its doors and needed more room to grow. He built and moved into his new office just a block south of his original site in 1986. His new office sported 4 operatories and what looked like extra room for many years to come. He employed a full time hygienist and added other auxiliary staff to handle the flood of new patients. It did not take long for him to decide he needed to employ an associate and another full time hygienist to help handle the increasing patient database for such a small area.\n<br>\n<br>In 2002 four more operatories were added to accommodate 2 full time doctors and 2 full time hygienists. The Meadville office location was opened in July 2003. The supporting staff is a well blended mix of full and part-time employees. Charlton Dental Associates has strived to continue the same gentle, caring, and friendly office atmosphere that started the success back in 1981.\n<br>\n<br>The doctors are dedicated to their continuing education and maintaining a modern dental practice. Utilizing the most advanced technical skills and dental equipment available Dr. Charlton is able to acquire low radiation digital x-rays, produce same day porcelain crowns and inlays, place implants to secure dentures or replace individual teeth, and use laser technology to perform painless surgery and cavity preparation. The office has a reputation of being a friendly, caring practice that works hard at making a dental visit fun and stress free. Come in and visit and see for yourself!\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"dr-deveshi-chandan\" class=\"align-center\">\n      Dr. Deveshi Chandan\n    </h2>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://chandandentistry.com/media/posts/4/doctor.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://chandandentistry.com/media/posts/4/responsive/doctor-xs.png 300w ,https://chandandentistry.com/media/posts/4/responsive/doctor-sm.png 480w ,https://chandandentistry.com/media/posts/4/responsive/doctor-md.png 768w ,https://chandandentistry.com/media/posts/4/responsive/doctor-lg.png 1024w\"  height=\"640\" width=\"640\" alt=\"\" />\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    Caring, compassionate and gentle is the reputation that precedes Dr. Deveshi Chandan, providing you with the best dental care possible.
